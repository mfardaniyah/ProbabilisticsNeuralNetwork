# ProbabilisticsNeuralNetwork
A probabilistic neural network (PNN) is a feedforward neural network, which is widely used in classification and pattern recognition problems. In the PNN algorithm, the parent probability distribution function (PDF) of each class is approximated by a Parzen window and a non-parametric function. Then, using PDF of each class, the class probability of a new input data is estimated and Bayesâ€™ rule is then employed to allocate the class with highest posterior probability to new input data. By this method, the probability of mis-classification is minimized.
